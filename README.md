# AP-CSA-Final: Academic Generator
Hello, and welcome to the Academic Generator. To make full use of the program, and to not result in any extraneous errors, please be sure to follow the prompts as directly specified in the program. That means when asked to input an integer or String in response of a prompt, please do so and do not add nor apply any other data types that do not follow what is being asked. There are some exception handlers found distributed in the code, but not all are placed in all prompts. With that being said, this program encompasses various of key features, such as gathering user input / data, and manipulating that data to create an academic resume. There will be sequences found in the execution of the code that establish "loading screens", after inputting various sources of data. For example, this can be seen after a user inputs their name, birthdate, grade level, and age, where the console is cleared and a series of statements appear. It is crucial you do not type or press the "enter" key in this process. Let it load, and continue on answering the prompts that will follow shortly after. After traversing through the entirety of the code, the generator will clarify when you have reached the end. It is then that you are able to leave the interface and successfully have ran through all what the code has to offer. Thank you for your interest in the program, and I hope you enjoy it.
